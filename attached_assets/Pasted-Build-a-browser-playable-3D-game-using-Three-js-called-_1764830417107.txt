Build a browser-playable 3D game using Three.js called “Finals Week Frenzy.”

Make the game simple, clear, and structured, with NO random features.

Produce three files:

index.html

style.css

main.js

Use only CDN scripts (no bundlers).

1. Game Description

The player is a university student in a 3D dorm room the night before finals.

Goal:
Collect all study materials before time runs out, while avoiding distractions that increase a stress meter.
The room slowly shrinks over 90 seconds.

2. Environment (Simple + Defined)

Build a single room using basic Three.js shapes:

Floor (plane)

Four walls (boxes)

Bed (box)

Desk with laptop (boxes)

Mini fridge (box)

Posters (flat planes)

Laundry pile (several stacked spheres)

Pizza boxes & cans (simple boxes + cylinders)

A window (plane) → the color outside changes from dark (night) to brighter (sunrise)

A simple wall clock → shows a countdown with HTML UI

Lighting:

Start warm white

Slowly shift to orange/red as time decreases

Room Shrink:
The walls slightly move inward over 90 seconds.

3. Player

First-person camera using PointerLockControls

Movement: WASD

Mouse: look around

No jump needed (optional)

4. Collectible Items (Study Materials)

Create exactly these five items with simple glowing colors:

Lecture notes (glowing plane)

Textbook (floating box)

Calculator (small box)

Study guide (flat book)

Lucky pen (thin cylinder)

When collected:

Remove object

Play a simple particle effect (small spheres)

Update UI counter

5. Distractions (Enemies)

Create simple floating objects that move slowly toward the player:

Smartphone (thin box)

Netflix cube (red box)

Discord icon (colored plane)

Pizza delivery knock sphere (sphere that bumps)

Text bubble (“wanna hang?” on a plane)

Music note cluster (three small spheres)

Enemy behavior:

Slowly follow the player

On contact → increase stress meter

6. Power-Ups

Add these simple pickups:

Coffee cup → speed boost for 5 seconds

Headphones → freeze enemies for 3 seconds

Focus pill → slow motion for 3 seconds

Each should slightly glow or pulse.

7. UI + Game Flow

HTML UI elements (simple text):

Stress bar (0–100)

Timer (90 seconds)

Materials collected (0/5)

Win condition:

All 5 items collected

Player touches the door object
→ Show “You Finished Studying!” screen

Lose conditions:

Stress reaches 100

Timer reaches 0

Walls get too close
→ Show “You Panicked!” screen

8. Technical Requirements

Use Three.js from CDN

Use requestAnimationFrame loop

Keep all models simple (basic shapes)

Put all JS in main.js

Code must run directly in Replit’s browser preview

9. Deliverables

Return the full project:

index.html

style.css

main.js

All game logic and visuals should be implemented with no placeholders other than basic shapes and colors.
